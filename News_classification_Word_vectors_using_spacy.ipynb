The British national, known as QT, had been refused a dependant s visa on the grounds that she was not a  spouse , even though she had entered a civil partnership in England. Marriage in Hong Kong is defined as a monogamous union between a man and a woman, but discrimination based on sexual orientation is against the law. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule with wide-ranging autonomy, including a free judiciary, in 1997.    In a unanimous decision reached by three judges, the Court of Appeal found that the director of immigration failed to justify the  indirect discrimination on account of sexual orientation that QT suffers . While the legal definition of marriage was not challenged in the appeal, chief judge Andrew Cheung wrote that  times have changed and an increasing number of people are no longer prepared to accept the status quo without critical thought .  Excluding a foreign worker s lawfully married (albeit same-sex) spouse or civil partner ... to join the worker is, quite obviously, counter-productive to attracting the worker to come to or remain in Hong Kong to work in the first place,  he added. The court ordered QT and the Department of Immigration to work together on an agreement and submit it to court within 28 days.  Hong Kong s LGBT advocates welcomed the decision, with the city s first openly gay lawmaker, Ray Chan, calling it a  big win for same-sex dependants to apply for a visa to stay in Hong Kong . Same-sex marriage was legalized in Taiwan in May, a first in Asia. In mainland China, homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder until 2001, but it is not illegal to be gay. \",\n          \"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s new coalition government will press ahead with plans to offer citizenship to the German-speaking minority in northern Italy, it said on Tuesday, but pledged to consult Rome on the project, which risks reopening century-old wounds. The dual-citizenship plan for the northern Italian region of Alto Adige was included in a 180-page coalition agreement published over the weekend by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz s conservative People s Party and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO). Alto Adige was ceded to Italy by Austria after World War One. Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini tried to settle thousands of ethnic Italians there in the 1920s, but German-speakers still outnumber Italians by around two to one. Italian and German speakers have their own schools and largely frequent different bars and restaurants. But the region enjoys enormous autonomy and generous handouts from Rome, which have helped dampen secessionist sentiment in the province. Kurz has said the scheme, which the FPO has long pushed for, is only meant to encourage cooperation between European states.  That is something that of course we only plan to do in close cooperation with Italy and with the government in Rome,  Kurz told a joint news conference with FPO chief and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache after their government s first cabinet meeting. Italian politicians have already roundly condemned Austria s plan, calling it a gesture to nationalism and saying it will threaten the delicate ethnic balance in Alto Adige, also known as South Tyrol. Italy s foreign minister was quoted by Italian news agency ANSA on Monday as saying that discussing the issue would be  a conversation that requires enormous delicacy . Kurz, however, downplayed any tension.  We have excellent contact with Rome. I am a personal friend of the head of government. I am a personal friend of the foreign minister s,  said Kurz, who was foreign minister until his new government was sworn in.  In our government program, we have complied with a wish of South Tyroleans that was expressed by all parties in South Tyrol and that above all was also expressed by the South Tyrolean provincial government,  Kurz said. Strache said Italy already has a similar arrangement in place for Italian minorities in Slovenia and Croatia. The Italian Foreign Ministry website lays out conditions under which people who lost their citizenship when some territories became part of Yugoslavia can apply for an Italian passport. The issue did not feature in Austria s parliamentary election in October, which Kurz s party won with a hard line on immigration that often overlapped with the FPO s. Austria took in a large number of asylum seekers during Europe s migration crisis. Both parties pledged to stop another such influx. In Austrian Tyrol, however, where maps of the province often still show the region to the south that is now part of Italy, it is still an emotional issue. That province, a stronghold of Kurz s conservatives, is due to hold an election for the local parliament in February. The head of Alto Adige s government, Arno Kompatscher, said he supported the plan as long as it was put in a European context of uniting nations rather than dividing them - a possible reference to any objections Italy might have.   It therefore has nothing to do with secession or moving borders or anything else. Rather it has to do with this expression of personal connection (to Austria) and the debate should take place in this context,  he told a news conference. The criteria on which citizenship would be offered were still open and should be the subject of discussions between Austria and Italy, he added.. Austria and Italy have clashed repeatedly in recent years over Austria s threat to introduce controls at the Brenner crossing, a vital transport link on their shared border, if the number of migrants arriving there from Italy rises sharply. So far that has not happened. \",\n          \"Tune in to the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) for another LIVE broadcast of  The Boiler Room  starting at 6 PM PST | 9 PM EST every Wednesday.

A Monday memo from a top Rauner aide said the Teachers\\u2019 Retirement System (TRS) board could decide at its meeting this week to lower the assumed investment return rate, a move that would automatically boost Illinois\\u2019 annual pension payment.  \\u201cIf the (TRS) board were to approve a lower assumed rate of return taxpayers will be automatically and immediately on the hook for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in higher taxes or reduced services,\\u201d Michael Mahoney, Rauner\\u2019s senior advisor for revenue and pensions, wrote to the governor\\u2019s chief of staff, Richard Goldberg. When TRS lowered the investment return rate to 7.5 percent from 8 percent in 2014 the state\\u2019s pension payment increased by more than $200 million, according to the memo.  Illinois\\u2019 fiscal 2017 pension payment to its five retirement systems was estimated at $7.9 billion, up from $7.617 billion in fiscal 2016 and $6.9 billion in fiscal 2015, according to a March report by a bipartisan legislative commission. The country\\u2019s fifth-largest state\\u2019s unfunded pension liability stood at $111 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, with TRS accounting for more than 55 percent of that gap. The funded ratio was a weak 41.9 percent. An impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature left Illinois as the only state without a complete 2016 budget. A six-month fiscal 2017 spending plan was passed in June. Mahoney cautioned that \\u201cunforeseen and unknown automatic cost increases would have a devastating impact\\u201d on Illinois\\u2019 ability to fund social services and education. One of Rauner\\u2019s top Republican legislative allies, Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno, urged the TRS board to delay a vote Friday to give the public time to weigh in on its possible actions. \\u201cThis issue is important enough at the very least to put the TRS board on notice we don\\u2019t want them taking any action that could cost taxpayers $200 to $300 million without appropriate scrutiny,\\u201d she said. TRS spokesman Dave Urbanek said the pension system was not aware of Mahoney\\u2019s memo until Tuesday and that Rauner\\u2019s office had requested \\u201cinformation about the scenarios under consideration.\\u201d He added TRS did not offer \\u201cpotential scenarios\\u201d either to the governor\\u2019s office or legislative leaders and noted the TRS board has not yet discussed the matter. \",\n          \"The outspoken comedian posed for a photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields in which she is holding a bloodied mask of President Trump.***WARNING***Photo is graphic and could be confused with an act of terror by an ISIS terrorist:Here s the gruesome ISIS inspired video that Griffin posted to Twitter:https://twitter.com/kathygriffin/status/869654650844098562TMZ published the gory photo from Griffin s photo session with the famed Shields, known for his shocking pictures.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Committee will mark up legislation reauthorizing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the $400 trillion U.S. swaps market as well as trading in agriculture, metals and energy.  Republicans, who are the majority in Congress and lead the committee, unveiled the bill late on Monday. A congressional source familiar with the legislation said lawmakers were open to negotiation and the bill could change before Thursday. The central aim of the Senate committee\\u2019s bill is to allow farmers, ranchers and energy providers to hedge their operational risks with derivatives, while maintaining regulation of financial swaps trading. The source said it was not an attempt to affect position limits that the CFTC sets on contracts or options.   The 2010 Dodd-Frank law strengthened oversight of swaps in order to prevent a repeat of the risky bets that contributed to the financial crisis. Republicans have said that rules the CFTC  put in place to carry out the law have spread regulation into areas outside of finance, which Congress did not intend. Nonetheless, the Senate bill would address some financial elements such as requiring electronic confirmation of customers\\u2019 account balances at banks and preventing firms from moving funds among accounts without notifying regulators. It would also strengthen protection for proprietary information submitted to the CFTC as part of required disclosures and create a judicial review process for the commission\\u2019s rulemaking. The bill unveiled on Monday would also require the commission to review and take action on the London Metal Exchange\\u2019s application to register as a foreign board of trade.  The CFTC has had to operate on year-by-year funding since the end of 2013 because Congress has not passed a new authorization for it. Lawmakers say this has created uncertainty in many markets. The House of Representatives passed its version of the CFTC authorization in June. Parts of that legislation that stirred controversy, such as a cost-benefit analysis requirement, were not included in this bill. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"August 23, 2016 \",\n          \"May 30, 2017\",\n          \"April 11, 2016 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The British national, known as QT, had been refused a dependant s visa on the grounds that she was not a  spouse , even though she had entered a civil partnership in England. Marriage in Hong Kong is defined as a monogamous union between a man and a woman, but discrimination based on sexual orientation is against the law. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule with wide-ranging autonomy, including a free judiciary, in 1997.    In a unanimous decision reached by three judges, the Court of Appeal found that the director of immigration failed to justify the  indirect discrimination on account of sexual orientation that QT suffers . While the legal definition of marriage was not challenged in the appeal, chief judge Andrew Cheung wrote that  times have changed and an increasing number of people are no longer prepared to accept the status quo without critical thought .  Excluding a foreign worker s lawfully married (albeit same-sex) spouse or civil partner ... to join the worker is, quite obviously, counter-productive to attracting the worker to come to or remain in Hong Kong to work in the first place,  he added. The court ordered QT and the Department of Immigration to work together on an agreement and submit it to court within 28 days.  Hong Kong s LGBT advocates welcomed the decision, with the city s first openly gay lawmaker, Ray Chan, calling it a  big win for same-sex dependants to apply for a visa to stay in Hong Kong . Same-sex marriage was legalized in Taiwan in May, a first in Asia. In mainland China, homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder until 2001, but it is not illegal to be gay. \",\n          \"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s new coalition government will press ahead with plans to offer citizenship to the German-speaking minority in northern Italy, it said on Tuesday, but pledged to consult Rome on the project, which risks reopening century-old wounds. The dual-citizenship plan for the northern Italian region of Alto Adige was included in a 180-page coalition agreement published over the weekend by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz s conservative People s Party and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO). Alto Adige was ceded to Italy by Austria after World War One. Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini tried to settle thousands of ethnic Italians there in the 1920s, but German-speakers still outnumber Italians by around two to one. Italian and German speakers have their own schools and largely frequent different bars and restaurants. But the region enjoys enormous autonomy and generous handouts from Rome, which have helped dampen secessionist sentiment in the province. Kurz has said the scheme, which the FPO has long pushed for, is only meant to encourage cooperation between European states.  That is something that of course we only plan to do in close cooperation with Italy and with the government in Rome,  Kurz told a joint news conference with FPO chief and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache after their government s first cabinet meeting. Italian politicians have already roundly condemned Austria s plan, calling it a gesture to nationalism and saying it will threaten the delicate ethnic balance in Alto Adige, also known as South Tyrol. Italy s foreign minister was quoted by Italian news agency ANSA on Monday as saying that discussing the issue would be  a conversation that requires enormous delicacy . Kurz, however, downplayed any tension.  We have excellent contact with Rome. I am a personal friend of the head of government. I am a personal friend of the foreign minister s,  said Kurz, who was foreign minister until his new government was sworn in.  In our government program, we have complied with a wish of South Tyroleans that was expressed by all parties in South Tyrol and that above all was also expressed by the South Tyrolean provincial government,  Kurz said. Strache said Italy already has a similar arrangement in place for Italian minorities in Slovenia and Croatia. The Italian Foreign Ministry website lays out conditions under which people who lost their citizenship when some territories became part of Yugoslavia can apply for an Italian passport. The issue did not feature in Austria s parliamentary election in October, which Kurz s party won with a hard line on immigration that often overlapped with the FPO s. Austria took in a large number of asylum seekers during Europe s migration crisis. Both parties pledged to stop another such influx. In Austrian Tyrol, however, where maps of the province often still show the region to the south that is now part of Italy, it is still an emotional issue. That province, a stronghold of Kurz s conservatives, is due to hold an election for the local parliament in February. The head of Alto Adige s government, Arno Kompatscher, said he supported the plan as long as it was put in a European context of uniting nations rather than dividing them - a possible reference to any objections Italy might have.   It therefore has nothing to do with secession or moving borders or anything else. Rather it has to do with this expression of personal connection (to Austria) and the debate should take place in this context,  he told a news conference. The criteria on which citizenship would be offered were still open and should be the subject of discussions between Austria and Italy, he added.. Austria and Italy have clashed repeatedly in recent years over Austria s threat to introduce controls at the Brenner crossing, a vital transport link on their shared border, if the number of migrants arriving there from Italy rises sharply. So far that has not happened. \",\n          \"Tune in to the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR) for another LIVE broadcast of  The Boiler Room  starting at 6 PM PST | 9 PM EST every Wednesday.

That s why the Mainstream Media is making such a big fuss out of nothing more significant than an incoming National Security Advisor speaking with one of his many foreign counterparts during the transitional period, but it s because of an alleged  technicality  pertaining to the 1799 Logan Act that this American Hero was able to be taken down by the  deep state .According to reports, the FBI  coincidentally  happened to be eavesdropping on Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the exact same time as he held one of his discussions with Flynn, and the story goes that the designated National Security Advisor   at the time legally still a  civilian    had made suggestions about American foreign policy which unwittingly put him in violation of the aforementioned law. Furthermore, he purportedly misled Vice President Pence about the full content of his conversation with the Ambassador, and this in turn contributed to the erosion of trust that ultimately led to Trump asking for his resignation.Almost right afterwards, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer declared that Trump  expects the Russian government to return Crimea , echoing UN Ambassador Nikki Haley s earlier copying of Obama-era sloganeering about  the Russian occupation of Crimea . This prompted mainstream and alternative voices to declare that Trump has revealed his  true face  and that there is  no hope  for a New D tente to ever materialize. The general sentiment from the mainstream media was that this was a good thing, while the alternative one rued the loss of this historic opportunity.Uncomfortable QuestionsBut is that really the right way to assess this situation?Flynn is an experienced operative in the US  deep state , and he should have known better than to clumsily slip up and speak about anything which could be remotely interpreted by his presumed anti-Trump eavesdroppers to be in violation of any arcane legislation. He probably made a simple mistake in terms of how he expressed himself and that s what s to blame for this whole scandal, but there s no way of knowing exactly what it was that he said until an official transcript becomes available, if ever. Nevertheless, judging by the euphemisms that he used in his resignation letter, it s evident that Flynn did in fact apparently mislead Pence as it related to his conversation with Ambassador Kislyak.Or that s what he wants everyone to think.It s doubtful that Flynn would have gone rogue on Trump simply due to the overzealousness that he might have felt towards helping to reach a New D tente, so no matter how taboo it may be to wonder, it can t help but be countenanced that whatever it is he spoke to the Russian Ambassador about, he did so with Trump s implicit approval and per the President-elect s suggestions. If this is the case, then Flynn might very well have misled Pence   The Establishment s most powerful figure in the new administration   but still took the fall in order to save Trump from possible impeachment proceedings under the 1799 Logan Act.PBHISTORY For The 21st CenturyAll the brouhaha that s being created over Flynn s resignation and the manufactured  deep state  scandal over his conversation with the Russian Ambassador is really just a 21st-century manifestation of the Old Cold War CIA project codenamed PBHISTORY. This operation took place in post-coup Guatemala after the US successfully overthrew government in 1954, and its objective was to concoct  evidence  that the former President was linked to the Soviet Union. This could then  justify  the coup that was just carried out, but what s happening to Trump right now is almost the reverse implementation of that plan.Instead of trying to link Trump to Moscow after his impeachment, the  deep state  is trying to do so in order to catalyze a  legal  regime change against him. Flynn is being presented as the strongest  evidence  allegedly connecting the American President to his Russian counterpart by wide degrees of imaginative speculation, but nevertheless, in the narrative-controlled vacuum of the Mainstream Media, this alternative reality has begun to take root and become a never-ending talking point among the army of paid shills that they employ. In order to wiggle out of this trap, Trump has reactively taken to parroting The Establishment s position towards Russia by sending Spicer out to channel his message about Crimea, just like he earlier preemptively did with Haley at the UN.Does D tente Even Matter In both cases, it s unclear whether Trump really believes these positions or not, but in the larger scheme of things, it doesn t, nor shouldn t, really matter too much. It would be ideal if the US finally matured to the point of seeing the world through Moscow s multipolar eyes and accepted the reality that Crimea is in fact Russian, but even if it doesn t, that doesn t change the facts on the ground. All that it does is confirm that the sanctions pertaining to the peninsula s historic reunification with Russia will remain in place, much to the consternation of some neoliberal political and economic influencers in Moscow who might want them lifted for the wrong self-interested reasons.Of course, it would be great if these economic restrictions were removed and the EU decided to follow suit because this could symbolically usher in a new era of cooperation between Russia and the West, though the downside is that the counter-sanctions would have to be lifted and Russian domestic producers   already enjoying an economic renaissance of sorts   would be forced to once more compete with their international counterparts on the Russian marketplace. The cost-benefit assessment pertaining to this either-or decision is entirely up to Russia s strategists and decision makers to calculate, and no judgement is being rendered in this regard, but it s an objectively expected fact that the Western recognition of Crimea s reunification with Russia might bode negatively for the competitiveness of some Russian companies (mostly agricultural) within their own country.Now that Flynn s out and Trump is doubling down on his anti-Russian rhetoric, it seems ever less likely that a New D tente will be reached anytime soon, so any hope that optimists may have had about the supposedly imminent removal of sanctions has just completely evaporated. Nevertheless, just because the US is reminding Russia of its traditional hostility to it in the European front doesn t mean that it necessarily has to behave that way in the Mideast one, which is why there s still a chance that the two Great Powers might indeed enter into some sort of joint cooperation against Daesh. If carried out with Damascus  blessing (whether stated or implied), then this could also work out to Russia s benefit as well.Or Was It Just A Deception?From the provocative position of being the  devil s advocate , and for the purposes of simply presenting an alternative angle to the latest events, it s very possible that the prior dream that Russian strategists and decision makers might have had about reaching a New D tente was nothing more than a carefully crafted deception by the US. While Moscow has officially said on multiple occasions that it hadn t discussed the removal of sanctions with Washington and has no illusions about the difficulty of restoring bilateral relations between the two countries, there was popular speculation in some corners that Russia was willing to engage in preliminary trust-building  concessions  in order to facilitate this presumed eventuality.There s of course no real proof that this was ever the case, but the narrative is convincing to many and relies on conjectures related to the Russian-written  draft constitution  for Syria and Moscow s refusal to conventionally intervene during the latest Ukrainian-provoked aggression against Donbas. The author refuted the first line of thinking in the  best-case scenario  that he outlined in a recent article on the topic, while an analysis from two and a half years ago about the threat of a  Reverse Brzezinski  still accurately accounts for Russia s refusal to invade Ukraine. Even assuming that the author was wrong, however, and that Russia really is  conceding  on multiple fronts in order to attain sanctions relief for its elite and a New D tente for its strategists, then the latest statements coming out of the White House must have certainly sobered up even the most diehard pro-D tente individuals in the Kremlin. Crimea left the Ukraine and joined the Russian Federation in March 2014 (Image Source: YouTube)The cold hard reality is that even if Trump sincerely wanted to recognize Crimea as part of Russia and remove the sanctions   whether out of a genuine desire to start a new era of relations or in order to cynically squeeze as many  concessions  from Moscow as possible beforehand   the domestic political situation in the US now makes it all but impossible for him to do so, let alone anytime in the near future. This shatters the hopes of the well-intentioned ideologues who truly believed that the dawn of new era was on the cusp of finally approaching, while it unprecedentedly was met with differing degrees of acceptance by both the Mainstream Media and Western neoconservatives on one side, but also foreign policy realists and  patriotic skeptics  from Russia on the other.The first group obviously wanted to do everything in their power to undermine a Russian-US rapprochement, while the second was extremely cautious about what Washington might have expected from Moscow in exchange for the New D tente. For whatever their respective reasons may be in regards to the causes that they support (Syria, Donbas) or even just in general, some of the foreign policy realists and  patriotic skeptics  in Russia felt uncomfortable with their country potentially  conceding  some of its recent geopolitical gains to the US as part of a grand bargain, despite it being impossible to ever reach a New D tente without both sides participating to some extent of deal-making.This  conservative  camp inadvertently got a boost from Flynn s scandal, however, since they can now leverage more influence on the Kremlin in convincing it of the need to double down on relations with China and Iran in response to the US  renewed aggression towards Russia and consider expanding their country s newfound partnerships with Turkey and Pakistan. There s no longer any semi-legitimate concern in any serious circles that Russia will  concede  anything on any of these fronts so long as Trump keeps up his hostile shtick (whether he really believes what he says or it s just a distraction from domestic problems).Whatever deception the US might have had in mind for Russia when hinting at a New D tente has disappeared and Moscow s honeymoon with Trump is now over.Draining The Swamp or Ruling Over It? Trump s volte face towards Russia has been exploited by critics and even those who sincerely believed in him in order to allege that he s not draining the swamp, but ruling over it. They draw attention to how the only real differentiating factor separating the Trump and Obama Administrations  policies towards the multipolar countries of Eurasia was that the 45th President was presumably poised to enter into cordial relations with Russia, and even that, as the author earlier forecast immediately after the election, was entirely dependent on draining the  deep state  foreign policy swamp. Other than this ambitious initiative, however, Trump has already disappointed many people when it comes to his stances towards China and Iran, which has led many people to conclude that he was trying to separate Moscow from the Eurasian Great Power Alliance and neutralize its multipolar effectiveness per a neo-Kissinger stratagem.Those fears can safely be discarded   for now   because it s highly unlikely that Russia would ever move in that direction   if at all   without any tempting carrots being offered by the US, such as the possible recognition of Crimea and a removal of the anti-Russian sanctions. Considering that the Trump Administration s foreign policy towards Russia, China, and Iran is almost identical to Obama s except for the possibility of pragmatic joint cooperation against Daesh in Syria (pending Damascus  uncertain approval, of course), then it s fair to say that Trump is essentially leading the swamp when it comes to foreign affairs and that little has structurally changed except for the nature in which the US manages its established spheres of influence in the Western Hemisphere and the Eurasian Rimland (which might admittedly lead to dynamic and unpredictable developments).Ask a regular Trump supporter, however, and most of them will totally disagree with anyone who says that Trump is ruling the swamp. The author isn t talking about the foreign policy wonks on Facebook or alternative international media, but the standard Joes and Sallys who voted for him in the Heartland and could honestly care less about International Relations except for when it comes to keeping the US out of another big war halfway across the world. The truth is that the generic Trump voter might have been sympathetic to their candidate s reasonable pragmatism towards Russia, but it was never really one of the main factors determining their support for him. Take it from a Clevelander, not a nuclear physicist, academician, Twitter troll, or jet-setting journalist, among the many professional tropes that have become influential in alternative media lately, because here s what the average Trump voter cares about (in any given order):* Building the wall with Mexico;* Kicking out illegal immigrants;* Cracking down on welfare and other related government benefit freeloaders;* Restoring law and order to America s gang-ridden and riotous streets;* Fighting the War on Hard Drugs;* Easing business regulations and taxes on the Working Class (including Obamacare) while creating and bringing back jobs; Trump supporters are also instinctively anti-Clinton, so since Hillary was a hawk against Russia, then they were automatically receptive to the softer stance promised by Trump. That s just the way it is, whether for right or for wrong, but because of this, most of the regular Americans who voted for Trump honestly don t care too much about his policy towards Russia so long as it doesn t impede his ability to carry through on the domestic agenda that won them over to his side in the first place. Trump s base, love it or hate it, is domestically focused and cares about  America First . Even if they disagreed with him on some elements of his foreign policy, they d still vote for him based on what he was promising to do domestically, which is how most of the electorate anywhere across the world typically behaves anyhow.This is the opposite of the position held by the majority of pro-Trump voices in the alternative media community (not counting Breitbart, of course), who might have been opposed to Trump s domestic policies but sided with him regardless because of his international ones vis- -vis Russia. Many non-Americans who frequent these online communities might have therefore come under the misleading impression that most of Trump s supporters think the same way as these influential voices do, which isn t exactly the case. Now that some of the pro-Trump alternative media influencers have turned on him due to his volte face towards Russia and have declared that he now leads the swamp, the non-American audience might think that this position is representative of the bulk of his supporters in general, which is once again inaccurate owing to the professional idiosyncrasies of these said voices relative to the Working Class core of Trump s movement.No matter which angle it s looked at, however, there s no escaping the observation that Trump is indeed ruling over the foreign policy swamp, but appears to be in full revolt against the domestic one, at least as it relates to the 7 key platforms earlier enumerated upon which profile the most important issues for the typical Trump voter. Just as Obama succumbed to the neoconservative  deep state  in order to have a relatively free hand in carrying out his domestic agenda, so too does Trump appear poised to do the same, although the 45th President might simply be choosing his battles wisely with the understanding that it might be impossible to drain two swamps at once and that he should go after the  lesser evil  (globally speaking) first before aiming for the greater one (if ever at all again). This has a lot to do with both his personal and political self-preservation, as Trump understands that his support base mostly doesn t even recognize that a foreign policy swamp exists outside of the Clinton Foundation and George Soros, neither of which he s obviously rubbing shoulders with, so to them, he s still draining the swamp so long as he stays loyal to the domestic concerns of his movement.Concluding ThoughtsThe neoconservative  deep state  ouster of National Security Advisor Flynn from Trump s Administration is a worrying development which shows that the Clintonian Counter-Revolution is proceeding apace and won t stop until Trump is either controlled or impeached.In reaction to this onslaught against his team and responding to the fake  Russian puppet  narrative which has come to dominate the Mainstream Media discourse, Trump started to full-throatedly parrot some of The Establishment s most well-known talking points against Russia, especially as they relate to Crimea. This marks a dramatic change in tone and rhetoric from the President and signals that the domestic political pressure that he s under right now as a result of the latest manufactured scandal is too overwhelming for him to fully continue with the hoped-for New D tente with Russia. Nevertheless, that doesn t mean that such an eventuality should be completely dismissed, since it s still possible in principle for the US to coordinate joint anti-Daesh strikes with Russia in Syria (conditional on Damascus  approval, of course). What s importantly changed, however, is that the prospects for a New D tente, or even the remote semblance of one, in Europe have markedly diminished, and this can t help but catch the attention of the Kremlin.It s unclear what goes on behind closed doors in the Grand Kremlin Palace and what sort of factions there are in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but there was previously some concern expressed in various sectors of the alternative media community that Moscow was at risk of  going soft  on the US in Syria, Donbas, and elsewhere in order to exhibit  goodwill gestures  designed to reach the grand goal of a New D tente and the pecuniary reward of sanctions removal. There were some speculations about this which contributed to a persistent and ever-growing narrative among various circles, and they in turn led some to wonder whether the pertinent arguments were based in objective reality or were just a convincing attempt at gaslighting. Whatever they may or may not have been is becoming irrelevant, however, since the readjusted expectations that Russia now has of the US after Flynn s ouster and Trump s embrace of neoconservative rhetoric about Crimea have emboldened the patriotic conservatives which were previously cautious and possibly even outright skeptical about the New D tente, thus mitigating the chances that Russia will engage in any unnecessary preemptive  concessions  towards the US so long as this attitude remains in place (key conditional).The foreign policy twists that are playing out in the Trump Administration towards Russia have led some influential pro-Trump supporters in alternative media to conclude that the President has given up on draining the swamp and is instead now ruling it, whether because he decided to show the true colors that he s had all along or out of self-interested reasons in preserving his own political and personal survival. The non-American audience which frequents the said alternative media platforms might come under the false impression that this sentiment mirrors that of the typical Trump supporter, which isn t necessarily the case owing to the professional particularities of some of the highest-profile commentators in this community. While they re certainly entitled to their individual analyses, they don t exactly channel the sentiment of the grassroots masses which brought Trump to power, and their positions towards the President are mostly determined by his foreign policy, unlike the domestic policy which motivates most of his base. That being said, while the author by no means condones Trump s anti-Russian rhetoric and expected complementary actions, he understands that this should be seen separately from the President s domestic agenda and therefore doesn t impact the reason why his movement supports him in the first place.Trump is definitely on the defensive when it comes to draining the foreign policy swamp, and the case can be argued that he s already in the process of being coopted by it to a large degree, but the situation is remarkably different when it comes to the domestic swamp that his supporters want him to drain. While the appointment of former Goldman Sachs investment banker Steven Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury completely goes against the presumable expectations of Trump s slogan, it s not an issue which takes absolute precedence to his base in comparison to the other reasons why they voted for him. Trump supporters want the President to restore law and order to their streets, fight hard drugs and crime, be tough on illegal immigration and unfair trade deals, and ease the draconian Obama-era regulations on small businesses (including Obamacare), which is what the populist leader is poised to do regardless of his foreign and macroeconomic policies. This isn t to endorse either of the latter, but simply to explain the reality that Trump is still very popular among his base and isn t perceived of as having  sold out , and the dichotomy between the alternative media narrative and the grassroots one is due to the differing emphasis that the first category of voices typically places on foreign policy as opposed to the second one s natural focus on domestic issues.All in all, Flynn s resignation is evidence that the  deep state s  Clintonian Counter-Revolution is in full swing and that it s successfully (and swiftly) removed one of his top advisors. The international consequences of this are apparent, and it s that Russia is much more reserved about the prospects of ever reaching a New D tente and is less likely to ever enter into any preemptive  concessions  (whether speculatively or substantially) aimed at attaining this. Russia will probably reinforce its relationships with China and Iran as well as expand its partnerships with newfound friends such as Turkey and Pakistan, while the US stands ready to return back to its Obama-era policies towards the multipolar leaders of Eurasia. For the most part, the Trump Administration s foreign policy is beginning to look almost identical to the Obama Administration s, but in spite of that, the President still enjoys overwhelming approval from his grassroots movement because of their reverence for his no-nonsense and  politically incorrect  approach to domestic issues. Whether this is a  good  or  bad  thing is for the reader to decide, but this is the objective reality as the author presently understands it, though fully accepting that it could quickly change in any and all regards depending on certain variables.For the moment, however, the diminished hopes over the New D tente aren t necessarily a defeat for Russia, and should contrarily be seen as an opportunity by its strategists and supporters for the reasons previously mentioned.DISCLAIMER: The author writes for this publication in a private capacity which is unrepresentative of anyone or any organization except for his own personal views.

The couples take issue with how the law defines infertility, which includes the inability to become pregnant after one or two years of unprotected sex, depending on a woman s age. Insurance companies have been able to deny coverage to gay patients who, although they have been medically diagnosed infertile, do not fit the definition, the suit says.Source: New Jersey.comErin Krupas is infertile.

The Iraqi government has transformed the balance of power in the north of the country since launching a campaign last week to seize back territory from the Kurds, who govern an autonomous region of three northern provinces and had also seized a swathe of other territory in northern Iraq. The Kurds held a referendum on independence last month that Baghdad called illegal. Baghdad responded by seizing back the city of Kirkuk, the oil-producing areas around it, and other territory that the Kurds had captured from Islamic State. Prime Minister Haidar Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory, and has also demanded central control of Iraq s border crossings with Turkey, all of which are inside the Kurdish autonomous region itself. A Kurdish official said Kurdish security forces known as Peshmerga had successfully beaten back an advance by Iranian-backed pro-government paramilitaries in the region of Rabi a, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Fish-Khabur border area. Fish-Khabur is strategically vital because oil from both Kurdish and government-held parts of northern Iraq cross at a pipeline there into Turkey, the main route out of the area for international export, crucial for any Kurdish independence bid. Abadi told a news conference in Baghdad he will discuss the issue of the border crossing with his Turkish counterpart Benali Yildirim on Wednesday in Ankara. The fighting so far has taken place outside the Kurdish autonomous region, but Fish-Khabur is located within it, so any assault on the border crossing would mark a major escalation, bringing government troops into undisputed Kurdish territory.  Crude oil flowing through the Iraqi Kurdistan pipeline to Turkey s port of Ceyhan were up slightly at 300,000 barrels per day on Tuesday, about half the level before the Iraqi takeover of Kirkuk, a shipping source in London said. The pumping rate has risen by about 50,000 bpd since Monday. An Iraqi military spokesman denied there had been any clashes in the area. But an Iraqi security source in Baghdad and a rights activist in northwest Iraq said the confrontation had started at dawn and was still going on by midday.  Peshmerga repelled the attack and pushed Popular Mobilisation back in to Rabi a,  tweeted KRG President Masoud Barzani s media advisor, Hemin Hawrami.  A military spokesman in Baghdad said in response:  There are no clashes.  The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is close allies of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government s army to fight against Islamic State.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Baghdad this week, but Abadi rebuffed his call for Iraq to reject the role of Iran-backed Shi ite paramilitaries that fight alongside government troops and have taken a hard line on the Kurds. An Iraqi government security advisor said on Monday Baghdad aimed to bring the three-way border crossing with Turkey and Syria at Fish-Khabur under its control, but he declined to say if a military move was being prepared. The Iraqi government s advance over the past week has been achieved with comparatively little violence, with Kurds mostly withdrawing without a fight. Nevertheless, Amnesty International reported that at least 11 civilians were killed and tens of thousands displaced from Kurdish areas of Tuz Khurmato, a town south of Kirkuk. It said images, videos, photos and dozens of testimonies indicated that hundreds of properties had been looted in a rampage targeting Kurdish parts of the ethnically mixed town. Elections for the presidency and parliament of Iraq s Kurdistan region set for Nov. 1 have been delayed by eight months, the regional parliament announced on Tuesday. The electoral commission said on Monday that parties had failed to present candidates amid turmoil in the region following the Sept. 25 independence referendum. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"vector\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
